### NeuralHarmony

## Overview
The Alphabet Soup Neural Network project utilizes a deep learning model to predict the success of funding applications for a non-profit organization, Alphabet Soup. The model is designed to analyze various features such as application type, affiliation, classification, and income amount to determine whether an application is likely to be successful. The goal is to create a predictive model that helps Alphabet Soup identify potential successful applicants and streamline their approval process.

## Data Preprocessing
1) __Data Import and Cleanup:__
   The project starts by importing the dataset (`charity_data.csv`) and dropping non-beneficial columns such as 'EIN' and 'NAME.' Additional columns like 'STATUS,' 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS,' 'USE_CASE,' and 'ORGANIZATION' are also removed.
2) __Feature Engineering:__
   The 'ASK_AMT' column values are normalized using the logarithmic transformation to mitigate the impact of extreme values. Categorical variables with low counts are grouped into an 'Other' category to prevent overfitting.
3) __One-Hot Encoding:__
   Categorical variables like 'APPLICATION_TYPE,' 'AFFILIATION,' 'CLASSIFICATION,' and 'INCOME_AMT' are converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
4) __Data Splitting:__
   The preprocessed data is split into features (X) and the target variable (y). A training and testing dataset are created using the `train_test_split` function.
5) __Standard Scaling:__
   The features are scaled using `StandardScaler` to standardize the dataset and enhance model performance.
   
## Neural Network Model
1) __Model Architecture:__
   The neural network model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture consists of multiple dense layers with varying numbers of units and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
2) __Hyperparameter Tuning:__
   The model's hyperparameters, such as the number of layers, units per layer, and dropout rates, are optimized using Keras Tuner.
3) __Early Stopping:__
   An early stopping callback is implemented with a patience of 3 epochs to monitor the accuracy and stop training if there is no improvement.
4) __Model Compilation:__
   The model is compiled using the binary crossentropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. The metric used for evaluation is accuracy.

## Model Training and Evaluation
1) __Training:__
   The model is trained using the scaled training dataset for 300 epochs or until early stopping criteria are met.
2) __Evaluation:__
   The model's performance is evaluated using the scaled testing dataset, and metrics such as loss and accuracy are reported.

## Model Export
